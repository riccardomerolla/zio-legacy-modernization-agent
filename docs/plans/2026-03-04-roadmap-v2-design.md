# Roadmap v2 — Consolidated Milestones + MCP Federation

**Date:** 2026-03-04
**Status:** Approved
**Supersedes:** [2026-02-23-roadmap.md](2026-02-23-roadmap.md)

## Context

The foundation work is complete:
- EclipseStore persistence with event sourcing (15 issues closed)
- Git worktree CLI agent runs with Docker sandbox (16 issues closed)
- M1: Core Platform — channels, models, sessions, routing (4 issues closed)
- M1: Tool Calling — all 3 providers + UX (6 issues closed)
- Agent Orchestration Platform — interactive sessions, git visibility, issue workflow, agent management (20 issues closed)
- ADT Event-Sourced Persistence with BCE restructure (7 phases closed)

30 open issues remain across 6 old milestones. This roadmap consolidates them into 5 focused milestones and adds a new MCP/Federation milestone.

## Architecture Decision: Multi-Gateway Coordination

**Approach: Hybrid — MCP for Tool Interface + Internal REST for Coordination**

- **MCP Server** on each gateway: exposes tools for external LLM clients (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to interact with the gateway — assign issues, run agents, query status.
- **Internal REST API** for gateway-to-gateway coordination: peer discovery, leader election, task delegation.
- **Leader gateway** receives tasks and dispatches to the best-fit peer based on agent capabilities and current load.
- **Peers** report status back via webhooks.

Why not pure MCP for everything? MCP is designed for LLM↔tool integration, not service-to-service orchestration. It lacks service discovery, consensus, and load balancing. A lightweight REST mesh is simpler and more appropriate for peer coordination.

## Milestone 3: Agent Intelligence & Memory

**Goal:** Context management, RAG, guardrails — the smart agent layer.

| Priority | Issue | Title |
|----------|-------|-------|
| P0 | #328 | Wire AgentDispatcher to ChatController |
| P0 | #329 | Apply context window management to conversations |
| P0 | #334 | Wire EmbeddingService + VectorStore to retrieval |

| P1 | #332 | [UX] Context window indicator |
| P1 | #331 | [UX] Agent browser in sidebar |
| P2 | #333 | [UX] Conversation checkpoint/branching UI |
| P2 | #336 | [UX] Knowledge base management page |
| P2 | #337 | [UX] RAG settings per conversation |
| P2 | #338 | [UX] Guardrails configuration |

## Milestone 4: MCP Server & Gateway Federation

**Goal:** External MCP tool interface + multi-gateway coordination.

### MCP Server (external interface)

Each gateway exposes an MCP server with tools:
- `assign_issue(title, description, workspace?, agent?, priority?)` — create and optionally assign an issue
- `run_agent(workspace_id, agent, prompt)` — trigger an agent run
- `get_run_status(run_id)` — query run status, output, git changes
- `list_agents()` — available agents with capabilities
- `list_workspaces()` — registered workspaces
- `search_conversations(query)` — search conversation history
- `get_metrics()` — LLM usage, agent performance

Transport: stdio (for local LLM clients) and SSE (for remote access).

### Gateway Federation (internal coordination)

- **Gateway Registry**: each gateway registers with a known seed peer via REST. Peers propagate the registry (gossip-style).
- **Leader Election**: simple bully algorithm — highest priority gateway becomes leader. Leader sends heartbeats; if missed, next in line takes over.
- **Task Delegation**: leader receives issues and dispatches to the best-fit peer based on:
  - Agent capabilities match
  - Current load (active runs / max concurrent)
  - Workspace locality (prefer peer that has the repo cloned)
- **Status Reporting**: peers push run status updates to leader via webhook. Leader aggregates for the federation dashboard.

| Priority | Issue | Title |
|----------|-------|-------|
| P0 | NEW | MCP Server — expose gateway tools via stdio + SSE |
| P0 | NEW | Gateway Registry — peer discovery and registration |
| P1 | NEW | Leader Election — lightweight leader/follower protocol |
| P1 | NEW | Task Delegation — dispatch issues to best-fit peer |
| P2 | NEW | Federation Dashboard — view peers, agents, load, delegated tasks |
| P2 | #278 | Security and approvals (agent action gates) |
| P2 | #275 | Pairing system (user approval for channel access) |

## Milestone 5: Extensibility & Power Users

**Goal:** Skills, scheduling, TUI.

| Priority | Issue | Title |
|----------|-------|-------|
| P1 | #271 | Cron jobs (scheduled messages and system events) |
| P1 | #270 | Skills system (pluggable capabilities marketplace) |
| P2 | #279 | System events and heartbeat |
| P2 | #277 | Terminal UI (TUI) |
